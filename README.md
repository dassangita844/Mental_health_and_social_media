# **Social Media and Its Adverse Effects on the Psychological Health of Students**

## **Introduction**

This research project investigates the relationship between social media usage and its adverse effects on the psychological health of students. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, the study analyzes behavioral and emotional patterns among school and university students, focusing on the impact of social media on mental health indicators such as sleep, depression, and emotional well-being. The project employs statistical methods and machine learning models to extract insights and highlight patterns in social media's psychological effects.

## **Research Objectives**

1. Analyze the influence of demographic factors (age, gender, relationship status) on students' average daily time spent on social media.  
2. Construct a composite Negative Impact Score derived from mental health indicators.  
3. Apply machine learning models to assess the relationship between social media usage and its negative effects on mental health.  
4. Investigate how social media contributes to sleeping issues using classification techniques.

## **Methods**

1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Cleaning and preprocessing the data (e.g., handling missing values, renaming variables).  
   - Encoding categorical variables for analysis.  

2. **Composite Index Creation**:  
   - Constructing a composite Negative Impact Score using 12 variables such as `distraction`, `worries`, `validation`, and `depressed` etc.  

3. **Machine Learning Models**:  
   - Regression and classification models to analyze the relationships between social media usage patterns and mental health indicators.
